# xahteiwi.eu

This repository builds the [xahteiwi.eu](https://xahteiwi.eu) web
site.

It uses [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/), and automatically
deploys with a GitHub Actions workflow that first sets off a Pelican
build and then invokes `ghp-import` (via `tox`). You're welcome to
[take a look at the workflow
implementation](https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
if you like.

If you see typos, grammar or syntax glitches, or factual errors, you
can [create a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/issues), send me a
pull request, or do a [GitHub
edit](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).
