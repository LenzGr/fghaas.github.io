Title: About comments on this site
Slug: comments

I've opted against including a comment facility on this site. My
rationale is this: if you find something interesting on this site and
want to discuss it, then share it on your favorite social network
(maybe give Mastodon a try!), and your friends will see what you
think. Unless you have exceptionally boring and stubborn friends, this
will stimulate the discussion far better than a random comment on a
random blog will.[^kriss]

[^kriss]: Hat tip to my former colleague [Kriss Andsten](https://twitter.com/andsten), whose thinking I borrowed here.

However, if you find something that's *factually wrong* in an article,
I would very much appreciate a correction. Since this blog is hosted
on GitHub, and built and published automatically from its repository,
there are a few things you can do to let me know something is wrong,
and help me fix it.

* File a GitHub issue. Go to my repo's
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/issues)
  and hit _New Issue._ I've created a couple of issue templates for
  you to choose from.

* Send a GitHub pull request. Just [fork my
  repo](https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/fork), create your
  changes on a topic branch, push it to your fork, and send me a
  PR. You can combine this with filing an issue, but for minor fixes
  that don't need discussion (such as a typo or grammar fix), just a
  PR is fine.

* Use the GitHub Edit feature. If you open any file in my repository's
  [`content/articles`](https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/tree/main/content/articles)
  directory, you'll find an Edit button (look for the ðŸ–‰ icon). That
  way, you can make an edit and create a PR directly from GitHub's web
  interface. It's functionally the same process as forking, editing
  your fork, and then sending a PR, but it makes the process a little
  bit smoother. You can test how that works by opening the edit mode
  for [the page you're currently
  reading](https://github.com/fghaas/fghaas.github.io/edit/main/content/pages/comments.md).

Also, if you have *something to add* to an article, you can follow the
same process in order to inject a reference or add a footnote.
