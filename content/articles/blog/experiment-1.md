Title: An experiment
Date: 2022-05-06

Slug: experiment
Summary: I am launching a small experiment. Would you like to help?

A little while back, I posted on my Twitter and Mastodon feeds[^crossposter]
asking people who kept a personal blog to post their RSS or Atom feed
URLs. A surprising number of people responded — many more on Mastodon
than on Twitter, incidentally, though I have about 15 times as many
Twitter as Mastodon followers. You can find the Twitter thread
[here](https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1515233714162356224) and the
Mastodon thread
[here](https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi/108140619829880299).

[^crossposter]: If you’re curious about these things: I use [Renato
  Cerqueira](https://lond.com.br/)’s [Mastodon Twitter
  Crossposter](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/) to mirror my
  Twitter feed to Mastodon, and vice versa. You can take a look at its
  [GitHub
  project](https://github.com/renatolond/mastodon-twitter-poster).

I now have a very decent aggregated feed, thanks to all who responded!

Now, normally, when I put a new post out, I chuck out a link to the
post on those two social networks. For some time, I’d like to do
something different, and if you’re inclined, you can help!

So what I’d ask you to do is subscribe to the [RSS
feed](/feeds/all.rss.xml) or the [Atom feed](/feeds/all.atom.xml) for my
site. For the next few things I post, I will **not** link them on
Twitter or Mastodon — but if you notice them in your feed and find them
share-worthy, I would very much appreciate if *you* posted them there.[^analytics]
Feel free to tag me in them, I’m `@xahteiwi` on Twitter and
`@xahteiwi@mastodon.social` on Mastodon.

[^analytics]: I don’t want to run Google Analytics on this site out of
  concern for your privacy, which is why I don't know where my traffic
  comes from. If you post them and tag me, I have something
  functionally approaching a pingback beacon.

I’d be really curious to see if it’s feasible in 2022 to reach blog
readers with essentially just an RSS feed, and word-of-mouth.

So, if you would like to participate, then just add my feed to your
reader, and keep your eyes peeled for the next few articles. Thank you!
