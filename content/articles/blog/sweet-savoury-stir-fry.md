Title: Sweet & savoury stir fry

Tags: Food, Recipe
Summary: Easy lunch. With meat, or vegan.

This is inspired by a dish that goes by "Mongolian beef" in parts of
the U.S., but I opted for the generic title since it's neither
Mongolian, nor does it require beef. It works with any red meat, but
you can also leave the meat out altogether, at which point this
becomes a vegan dish.

I normally serve this with jasmine or basmati rice. I have yet to try
it with [udon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udon), which I am
guessing should work well too.


## Ingredients

Amounts are for 4 servings.

Meat (optional):

* About 400g of red meat (beef flank steak, or leg of lamb)
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp rice vinegar (or [Shaoxing
  wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaoxing_wine), for a finer
  flavor)
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 3-4 tbsp cornstarch or potato starch
* 4-5 tbsp peanut oil (for frying)

Vegetables:

* 2 tbsp peanut oil (for frying)
* 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 1-2 red bell peppers, cut into 2cm squares
* 1 hot chili pepper, seeds removed (alternatively a jalapeño pepper,
  if you like it milder), chopped
* 180g (drained) bamboo shoots
* 5-6 scallions (spring onions), cut diagonally into 2-3cm pieces

Sauce:

* 2 tbsp granulated sugar
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp [hoisin sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoisin_sauce)
* 2 tbsp sesame seeds
* 1 tbsp cornstarch or potato starch
* 1 tbsp rice vinegar (optional)


## Equipment

* 1 small bowls (for sauce)
* 1 medium-size bowl (for meat)
* Cooking knife and board
* Whisk
* Large skillet or wok


## Method

1. Prepare the sauce: whisk sugar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame
   seeds, and optionally rice vinegar together in a small bowl and set
   aside.

2. If you're including the meat: prepare the marinade by whisking all
   liquid ingredients together in a medium bowl. Cut the meat into
   very thin strips and put them in the bowl. Marinate for at least 20
   minutes.

3. Toss the meat in the cornstarch or potato starch.

4. Heat peanut oil in the skillet or wok on high heat. Fry the meat in
   batches until the starch turns golden brown, about 3 minutes or so
   per batch, keeping heat on high. Put fried meat aside in a bowl.

5. Vegetable fry: heat peanut oil in wok or skillet on high
   heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant but not brown. Add bell peppers,
   chili pepper, and bamboo shoots. Continue frying on high heat for
   about a minute.

6. Add the cut scallions, mix thoroughly. Cover skillet or wok with a
   lid, and cook vegetables for about 5 minutes in their own
   steam. Taste the scallions. If they've lost their onion punch and
   developed a slightly sweet taste but still retain some crunch,
   they're perfect.

7. If going for the meat option, return the fried meat to the wok or
   skillet.

8. Pour the sauce prepared in step 1 over everthing, mix thoroughly,
   and keep cooking for another 30-60 seconds until sauce thickens.

9. Serve.
