Summary: Find yourself hungry in Tel Aviv? I can help.

My Fediverse friends recently [encouraged
me](https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi/109530424824273292) to share
places where I liked to eat in cities I've travelled to. And since I'm
just back from Tel Aviv, here are 3 of my favourite places to grab a
bite in that city.

## Benedict

[Ben Yehuda St 171, Tel Aviv](https://goo.gl/maps/murjHLsfmCx6xMz69)

A 24/7 breakfast restaurant that is an excellent location for
[shakshuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakshouka), but it also
makes the best [Eggs
Benedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggs_Benedict) I've found
outside Auckland (this doesn't reflect poorly on the place --- Eggs
Benny from Auckland are unbeatable). In my opinion, the top item on
the menu are the ones with the lamb bacon and spinach.

Benedict has several locations around the city. The most conveniently
placed one for touristy purposes is arguably the one on
[Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_Boulevard);
there's also one in [Sarona
Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarona_Market), but my favourite
branch is somehow the small one on [Ben
Yehuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Yehuda_Street_(Tel_Aviv)).


## Falafel Frishman

[Frishman St 42, Tel Aviv](https://goo.gl/maps/s7NyMFrW549b2pZq5)

Best [falafel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falafel) I've ever had. I
prefer the full falafel platter (with *generous* amounts of [Arab
salad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_salad), hummus, and pickles)
over the pita sandwich.

My local friends tell me the
[sabich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabich) next door is also
excellent, but I haven't tried it myself since I'm not too hot on
hard-boiled eggs (sorry!).


## Haj Kahil

[David Razi'el St 18, Jaffa](https://goo.gl/maps/MSNwU9fZduvshJsQA)

An Arab cuisine place in Jaffa just outside the old town, on Clock
Tower square. The starters are mindblowing and delicious, and the
meats are absolutely divine. Bonus: you have a lovely walk back to the
central Tel Aviv hotel district, via the waterfront boardwalk.
