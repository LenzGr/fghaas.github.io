Summary: Dear conference organizers, I use my preferred slide deck framework for a reason. Please don't try to second-guess me.

Dear conference organizer,

Please do not attempt to foist a slide deck format on me. Please stop
asking for a PowerPoint deck, or a Google Slides link, or a PDF. And
if these are the only formats you are willing to accept, please do
state that clearly and up front in the CFP, because it means I won't
be submitting a proposal to your conference.

I am not doing this to annoy you, or make your life harder. It's just
that the presentation stack I have settled on is far superior to the
ones you are suggesting, and I am disinclined to compromise on
quality.

I use the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation framework,
and publish my slide decks using [GitHub
Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). I
provide a public URL to my slides ahead of time — always at the
beginning of the talk, and also in advance if requested, in case
you want to put the link in your conference programme.

This approach allows me to do things that — to the best of my
knowledge — neither PowerPoint, nor Google Slides, nor a PDF allow me
to do, which I consider essential in the interest of my (that is,
your!) audience:

* I always encourage people who sit at the back of the room, or who
  have vision acuity issues, to open my slides on their phone or
  tablet as I start the talk (I provide a full-size QR code for that
  purpose; [here is an
  example](https://fghaas.github.io/writing-professionally/#/0/1)). reveal.js
  [Multiplex](https://revealjs.com/multiplex/) then allows me to
  advance my slides on the big screen or projector, and the slides on
  people's personal devices will advance in lockstep. This enables
  everyone to follow along without having to crane their neck or
  squint their eyes.

* My slides always use the reveal.js black-on-white theme (which works
  best even if lighting conditions in the presentation room are
  unhelpful), and I include the reveal.js [menu
  plugin](https://denehyg.github.io/reveal.js-menu/) with a theme
  switcher. This enables people who cannot look at bright screens for
  a long time (migraine patients come to mind) to switch to the dark,
  white-on-black theme as they follow along on their own device, which
  tends to make their talk experience more pleasant. To see what this
  looks like, open [this
  deck](https://fghaas.github.io/writing-professionally), then click
  the ☰ icon or hit the `m` key, and go to _Themes → Black_.  
  On a related note, please don't prescribe a slide template or colour
  scheme either, *unless* your template designers have made better
  accessibility accomodations than I have (at which point I will be
  more than happy to work those into my slide deck design).

* reveal.js comes with a magnificently useful and highly flexible
  [pacing
  timer](https://revealjs.com/speaker-view/#speaker-notes-clock-and-timers),
  which enables me in my delivery to keep time very precisely, and
  even allows me to make timing changes in a hurry. For example, if my
  50-minute talk starts 5 minutes late because of a scheduling
  issue, I can make a quick change to make up that time without
  compromising talk quality, and without the talk getting rushed at
  the end. Good schedule-keeping enhances the quality of your
  conference, and reduces your stress level as an organizer.

* The fact that my slides live on GitHub, and are automatically
  published with a `git push` command, enables me to make last-minute
  modifications in relation to other talks previously seen in the
  conference. This keeps me from sharing information that is outdated,
  lets me add new information from your conference that is useful, and
  will thus make my talk (and your conference!) more practically
  relevant.

* Immediately after my talk is done, I re-push my slides with inline
  speaker notes enabled. (To see what this looks like, [look at this
  example](https://fghaas.github.io/devopsdaystlv-2019/).) You
  *always* get my talk with my full speaker notes, meaning every
  single one of my talks comes with a full transcript. This is
  beneficial to people with attention issues, and also greatly
  facilitates hallway track conversations — because people can always
  refer back to something I said, without having to try to remember
  and discern it from the slides' contents.

You get all this for the small price of opening one more browser tab
on your presentation and A/V production laptop. It might add a small
amount of extra work for the people who run your A/V production; I
acknowledge that and ask you and them to please accept that extra
burden. But I promise you it'll be a net win for our audience.
