Summary: An update on my small RSS/Mastodon/Twitter social media experiment

My [social media experiment]({filename}experiment-1.md) is still
ongoing. A week without posting articles on social media, while asking
people to subscribe my RSS feed, has yielded

* practically zero engagement on Twitter (except for [the article on
  Drizzle]({filename}drizzle.md) article, which was reviewed by other
  people and then shared by my reviewers),

* very much non-zero engagement on Mastodon (where some of my
  followers have apparently been subscribers to my RSS feed for quite
  a while).

This doesnâ€™t surprise me much: evidently, the habit of subscribing to
feed sources via RSS comes more naturally to citizens of the
Fediverse.

One nice upside of the experiment is that **I** have been enjoying
content written by others more. My aggregation of about 20-or-so
feeds, followed via
[Aggregator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tughi.aggregator),
gives me about 1 to two notifications new post per day, and most of
those I find truly enjoyable and insightful.

I will now progress to phase II in my experiment which is to throw new
posts out via RSS and Mastodon, but not on Twitter.
