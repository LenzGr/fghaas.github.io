Summary: My company's MD recently put out a well-written email update instead of calling an all-hands meeting. It was excellent.

I am sure that many of you have been summoned to your fair share of
quarterly, end-of-half-year, or end-of-year updates which were held by
way of a company meeting. You probably didn't like them too much,
maybe even dreaded the thought of 45 minutes (or longer!Â ðŸ˜±) of Death
By PowerPoint. But perhaps you didn't mind turning up because hey, at
least it was free coffee and donuts.

When the pandemic rolled around, many organizations turned that
quarterly all-hands summons into a quarterly all-hands *virtual*
summons, in the shape of a video call. Now you had to supply your own
self-funded donuts, and probably didn't like the idea of staring into
a camera for 45 minutes straight (or longer!Â ðŸ˜–ðŸ”¨). Worse still, I
hear that some of you might be have been subjected to virtual
*pre-recorded* events, where you could watch an executive pontificate
from a script, with no interactivity whatsoever. Something, I imagine,
that is approximately as engaging as watching a wannabe investment
advisor on a YouTube channel with 6 subscribers, 4 of them relatives.

Last week, our Managing Director Jim (who, to his credit, previously
ran these events in a reasonably engaging fashion) did something
different. At the end of our second quarter, and a few days before
going on annual leave, he sat down and wrote an email. As in, he
actually *sat down* and wrote an email. It had structure, it had a
format, it had clear messaging, it was to the point.

## What was in the message?

I'm obviously not going to go into the detailed content of the
email, but here's what stood out:

* The message started with an intro that clearly settled the reader's
  expectations: this is what I'm writing about; this is what you'll be
  reading.

* It clearly delineated that some of the items discussed were going to
  be somewhat negative (as in, worthy of improvement); many others
  were positive. It also clearly established that the negatives were
  coming first, and the positives thereafter.[^negatives-first]

* It used paragraphs, which were clearly separated by topic. As you
  read, you knew exactly where one thought concluded and the next one
  started.

* It conveyed an obviously personal viewpoint: Jim was giving his own
  perspective on things, rather than writing like a detached
  omniscient narrator.

* It was very evident that Jim hadn't just bashed out the message and
  sent it off in a hurry, but that some careful re-reading and editing
  went into it. I have no idea if he did this by himself or asked
  someone else to go over it with him, but *that does not matter:*
  what matters is that he edited, not whether he was his own
  editor.[^editor]

[^negatives-first]: This is an excellent move on two counts: first,
    readers naturally perceive what comes last as being emphasised. By
    getting the negatives out of the way first, the positives stick in
    people's minds more strongly. Second, it establishes that once you
    get to the positives, there is no further downer coming to
    sucker-punch you.

[^editor]: A trusted editor is a gift from god (if you believe in such
    things). I can highly recommend asking someone you enjoy working
    with to lend you an extra pair of eyes to go over what you
    write. I was mutual editors with
    [ElenaÂ Lindqvist](https://twitter.com/elenalindq) for two years;
    it was glorious.


## What else is good about this?

Best of all, the whole thing was a remarkable exercise in
efficiency. Jim put his thoughts into *precisely* 1,500
words.[^precision] As I've [pointed out
elsewhere]({filename}this-meeting-should-have-been-an-email.md),
information you can express in 1,500 concisely written words is at the
top end of what you can convey in a 60-minute verbal meeting â€” but
when put in writing, it takes a fluent English speaker only about
6 minutes to read.

[^precision]: I am told this exact round-number precision was
    coincidence.

How does this compare to the conventional meeting-based approach?

* Had Jim prepared slides and a speech for an all-hands meeting, it
  would have taken him at least two hours, plus the hour of conducting
  the meeting. He probably spent the same total of three hours writing
  out, rereading, and editing his message. So the total effort *he*
  had to spend on his email was about the same he would have needed to
  spend on the preparation and the conduct of a meeting.

* For everyone else, that is the other 98% of the company, reading the
  email took **one-tenth** of the time that participating in a meeting
  conveying the same information would have taken. Jim gave back 90%
  of the productivity that would have been spent in a meeting, to 98%
  of the company.

## Makes sense, doesn't it?

Yes it eminently does. So, next time you consider summoning your whole
company to an all-hands meeting or video call, try to be a little more
like Jim.
