Summary: Need a bite in Berlin?

My Fediverse friends recently [encouraged
me](https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi/109530424824273292) to share
places where I liked to eat in cities I've travelled to. So here are 3
of my favourite places to grab a bite in Berlin. These are three
picks from a list that is at least three times as long, from three
different city boroughs.

## Lemon Grass Scent

[Schwedter Straße 12, Prenzlauer Berg](https://goo.gl/maps/9Won2uVUGByeSQqT6)

You may scoff at Asian fusion because you've seen too many places that
are terrible at it. This place is excellent. It's particularly lovely
in the summer when you can sit at one of the curbside tables outside
on a balmy evening.

## Bejte Ethopia

[Zietenstraße 8, Schöneberg](https://goo.gl/maps/6EjQQFz7mxyYUAfEA)

Get your [injera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injera) fix here! This
is a lovely cozy place that I'd suggest you visit with a small
group. Highly vegetarian/vegan friendly, although they have excellent
meat dishes as well.


## Restaurant L'Escargot

[Brüsseler Straße 39, Wedding](https://goo.gl/maps/dRzibQHos4XtrEv96)

I'll happily recommend the eponymous snails, but this is also known to
be a source of excellent coq au vin.
