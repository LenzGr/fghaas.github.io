Title: Bye, Birdsite
Date: 2022-11-12 10:30
Slug: bye-birdsite
Summary: Find me on the Fediverse.

This is just to let people know that as of today, I am no longer
active on [the birdsite](https://twitter.com/xahteiwi).

I have deleted my 15,227 tweets (going back to 2015-08-25, just over 7
years) using [TweetDelete](https://tweetdelete.net/), and am leaving
just a single one up to let people know where I went.

At this point, I have no intention to resume my activity there. You
can find me on the Fediverse, and I'd be delighted to connect with you
there. My primary Fediverse account is currently
[@xahteiwi@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi); if I
ever move to a different instance I'll be sure to set up a
[redirect](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration).
