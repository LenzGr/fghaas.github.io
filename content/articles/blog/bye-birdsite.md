Title: Bye, Birdsite

Summary: Find me on the Fediverse.

This is just to let you know that as of today, I am no longer active
on [the birdsite](https://twitter.com/xahteiwi).

I have deleted my 15,227 tweets (going back to 2015-08-25, just over 7
years) using [TweetDelete](https://tweetdelete.net/), and am leaving
just [a single
one](https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1591384758663409664) up to
let people know where I went.

At this point, I have no intention to resume my activity there. You
can find me on the Fediverse, and I'd be delighted to connect with you
there. My primary Fediverse account is currently
[@xahteiwi@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@xahteiwi); if I
ever move to a different instance I'll be sure to set up a
[redirect](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#migration).

I might still occasionally re-run
[Fedifinder](https://fedifinder.glitch.me/) to find people that I'd
been following, or that I had added to lists, and then follow their
Fediverse identities. So, if you're also moving, please consider
adding your Fediverse handle (or a link to your profile) to your bio.
