Title: Writing Professionally (C!Conf 2022) 
Date: 2022-05-30

Summary: I did a workshop on writing in a professional context at my employer's annual unconference, C!Conf.

At work we have an annual[^annual] conference, *C!Conf,* where we pull
the whole company together for 3 days of talks and workshops. All
conference sessions are conducted by employees â€” we don't bring in any
external consultants or (deity forbid) "motivational speakers", so it
tends to be a very productive affair.

[^annual]: For obvious reasons, we didn't have this event in 2020 and
    2021, so this was actually the first we did in 3 years. But the
    intention is for it to be an annual occurrence.

This year I ran a 45-minute session on writing in a professional
context. There is no recording, but the whole talk is available with
my full speaker notes at
