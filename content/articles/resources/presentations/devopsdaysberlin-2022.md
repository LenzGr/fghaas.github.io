Summary: I couldn't make it to DevOpsDays Berlin, because my Covid status kept me from travelling. Thus, here's a write-up.

At [DevOpsDays Berlin
2022](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-berlin/program), I was slated
to give a 30-minute talk titled *Writing Professionally.*
Unfortunately a positive Covid test just three days prior to my
departure threw a wrench in those plans, and I was unable to travel or
attend a conference (much less speak at one, unmasked).

So, I am converting my talk into a write-up, before any symptoms set
in.

# Writing Professionally (in English)

This is a talk about developing superpowers. Superpowers that will
help you be better in any role, any industry, any profession —
*particularly* the ones where you work in distributed teams, and use
an asynchronous and distributed workflow.

This is about expressing yourself clearly, succinctly, and
professionally in writing. I have put this together for the English
language, though parts of this talk may be applicable to other
languages as well.

This is about **writing well** in a professional context. That means
we're not talking about poetry, or creative writing, or writing a
message to a friend. We're talking about writing in the context of
professional communications.


## Being understandable

When you write in a professional context, **your goal** is the
**reader** (or readers) **understanding you.**

That is really the overarching goal, and it's important to understand
that we must do everything we possibly can to make it easy for our
reader to understand what we mean.

When you're writing a novel, you can add plot twists and
surprises. You can even use a literary device called an unreliable
narrator, where at the very end of the novel you reveal that
everything the narrator said (or the protagonist did) was a lie, a
delusion, or a dream.

In professional writing, we don't have that luxury. We must write in
such a way that whoever reads our writing, understands us.

And that is the overarching goal no matter the mode we use to
communicate. Writing to be understood extends to

* email messages,
* chat messages,
* issue descriptions and comments (in whatever issue tracker you might be using; this includes Jira tickets, Trello cards, GitHub issues and the like)
* collaboratively edited documents (like wiki pages or shared Google docs)
* meeting notes (more on those in a bit), and of course
* technical documentation.

And in writing, your No. 1 priority is **clarity.**

Not beauty, elegance, or cleverness. Those all have their place, and
there is some room for them in professional writing as well, but you
should never sacrifice clarity for any of them.

I would also say that being clear is more important than being
friendly. If there is something that you need to express, but you
can't do it in a friendly manner if you're being clear, I'd say you
should be clear, rather than friendly. **However,** not being
particularly *friendly* doesn't mean being *disrespectful* — even if
you're expressing strong disagreement, you can do so in a respectful
manner.


## Clarity takes two forms

Writing clearly can mean one of two things:

* Clarity of *expression,* that is, caring about how we write each
  sentence (and word, really) with a view toward maximum clarity.

* Clarity of *structure,* that is, caring about how we design
  "documents" (in the broadest sense), so that they are clear and easy
  to understand, and are useful for communication.

Both of them are equally important, and they depend on each other: a
beautifully structured document is useless if it's full of gibberish,
and splendidly clear words are useless if they end up in an
unstructured wall of text.

So we'll spend some time on both, starting with clarity of expression.

# Orwell's Six Rules

One of the simplest, most concise, and most useful rulesets for
writing clearly in the English language comes from [George
Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell)'s 1946 essay,
*[Politics and the English
Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language).*

In it, Orwell suggested six rules for writers to follow:


## Rule 1

> Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you
> are used to seeing in print.

What Orwell means by this is essentially, "don't try to be clever". If
you're using a metaphor, chances are that it's not original, that
somebody else has used it before, and that people may see it as a
tedious trope.

More importantly though, your reader might simply not be familiar with
the metaphor, depending on their background. As an example, if your
readers are from Germany, or are medieval scholars from somewhere in
Western Europe, they will probably understand what you mean by calling
a salesperson a [Pied
Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin). If they
are not, your readers will be very confused by your reference to a
13th century rat exterminator (or musician, depending on viewpoint) in
your writing.


## Rule 2
> Never use a long word where a short one will do.

It's remarkable how much clearer your writing gets if you ruthlessly
edit it. English almost always gives you a choice between using a long
word, and a shorter one with the same meaning. Always opt for the
short one. Rather than *utilise,* write *use.* Rather than saying
*methodology,* say *method.* Instead of *I don't mean to insinuate,*
you can write *I don't mean to suggest.*


## Rule 3
> If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.

When you're using shorter words instead of longer ones, you cut
syllables and letters from your writing. Naturally, you can also
extend that concept to cutting whole words.

There's a famous quote that fits well with this particular rule that
comes from the French writer, poet, and aviator [Antoine de
Saint-Exupéry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry)
(best known to English-speaking readers for his novella *[The Little
Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince)*).

> « Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus
> rien à ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien à retrancher. »
>
> (*Terre des hommes*, 1939)

In English, that roughly translates to:

> It appears that perfection is achieved not when there is nothing
> left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

(I say roughly because *cut away* would be a better translation than
*take away,* but in English the former sounds unnecessarily harsh.)

It needs to be said that this quote disagrees with itself a bit,
because it does contain a phrase that is perfectly okay to edit
out. If he followed his own advice (and was a little more assertive),
Saint-Exupéry could have written:

> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but
> when there is nothing left to take away.

But it is a good quote to go by, still. If you make it part of your
mindset to send an email, or hit the *Save* button on an issue comment
not when you can't think of anything to add, but when you've tried to
trim all the fat and find nothing else to trim, that will make you a
better professional communicator.


## Rule 4
> Never use the passive where you can use the active.

Orwell's rule No. 4 states that you should be using the active voice
whenever you can. There are some exceptions to this, but in general
the active voice tends to be shorter, more concise, and thus clearer
than the passive voice.

* Passive voice: The system was rebooted.

* Active voice: We rebooted the system.

Sometimes, it's difficult for non-native speakers to even *recognize*
that they are using the passive voice. There's a neat little trick to
apply here: if you can take the sentence and append "by dragons" to
it, then it's passive voice.

Applying this rule, we could edit the Saint-Exupéry quote even more
radically:

> We achieve perfection not when we can't add anything, but
> when we can't take anything away.

Now of course, the quote becomes less and less poetic as we edit
it. I'm not trying to say that Saint-Exupéry ought to be writing any
differently than he did. What I'm trying to say is that the last
version is probably the clearest to most people (including those for
whom English is their second or third language), and that in
professional communications we shouldn't strive to be poetic, we
should strive to be clear.


## Rule 5

> Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if
> you can think of an everyday English equivalent.

Orwell's fifth rule emphasises simplicity and accessibility. If there
is an uncommon word that means *the same thing* as a common one, always
use the common one.

Note that this means that you can — and should — use technical terms
if they have *no* everyday equivalent. That's simply because using an
imprecise term would mean *losing* clarity, when compared to using a
precise term. But when we have one that we *can* easily replace with a
common word, we should do so.

For example:

1. This is a favourable conceptualization.
2. This is a good idea.

Here, we can simply replace the uncommon terms with common ones.

Another example in the corporate world is that we can easily replace
the jargon term "human resources" with "people", and also replace
"acquire" with "hire" or "buy", depending on context.

1. For this project we'll need to acquire more human resources.
2. For this project we'll need to hire more people.


## Rule 6
> Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

And finally, Orwell reminds us that while this ruleset is a good
guideline to follow, it is not absolute.

Yes, *sometimes* the passive voice is just fine, such as when you want
to make a point of not assigning blame for something that went wrong,
to a particular individual or group. Sometimes you can include a witty
quote unedited, even though it used jargon or a foreign word.

But having the rulebook in the back of your mind at all times is
guaranteed to improve your writing.


# Little things

Let's look at a few other, small things that you can think about to
make your writing better.


## Parallelism

Parallelism (parallel structure) is the simple rule that if you are
using a particular structure in a sentence, then you keep using that
structure until the end of the sentence.

1. We wanted to know the time, the place, and where we were going.

2. We wanted to know the time, the place, and the destination.

In this example, both sentences are correct English, even though the
first one may sound a little colloquial.

The second sentence is clearer, because the use of "we wanted to know
the time, the place, and" primes the reader to expect another
instance of the definite article "the", followed by a noun. Finishing
the sentence by "the destination" makes for a more straightforward
reading experience.


## Emphasis goes last

Most English speakers subconsciously read the end of a sentence as
being more important than its beginning. Thus, whatever you consider
the more important aspect should go at the end of the sentence for
emphasis.

1. The drug is highly effective, but has significant side effects.

2. The drug has significant side effects, but is highly effective.

The first example emphasises the side effects. Thus, most readers
would read it as a warning to prescribe the drug with caution. The
second example emphasises the drug's effectiveness, and could thus be
seen as an encouragement to prescribe the drug for treatments.


## Effectively using bullets in a sentence

In professional writing, you often have the opportunity to make a long
sentence much more readable, by simply injecting bullets.

Take this example:

> It is important that we listen to the customer's needs, build a good
> solution that keeps us within the applicable regulatory framework,
> and clearly delineate responsibilities in the proposal and SLA.

This sentence is perfectly correct, and it isn't even awkwardly
structured. It is just a long, run-on sentence, which most readers
will find difficult to grasp at a glance. You probably reread it once
or twice.

Compare this version:

> It is important that we 
> 
> * listen to the customer's needs,
> * build a good solution that keeps us within the applicable regulatory
> framework, and
> * clearly delineate responsibilities in the proposal and SLA.

In this version, *not a single word has changed.* The statement could
still use further editing. But even at this stage, most people will
find reading this version much easier than reading the original. That
is because most readers will be able to grasp the initial part of the
sentence, "it is important that we", at a single glance, and will also
be able to notice at a glance that there are three bullets.

That is to say that without even reading it in full, your reader will
understand that you are about to mention what's important, and that
there are three things you suggest to consider.


## Writing positively

Writing positively means to write using affirmations, rather than
negations. In other words, you state *what is,* rather than stating
*what is not.*


1. The project manager may not hire outside contractors except those
   that have been carefully vetted for reliability.

2. The project manager must vet all outside contractors for
   reliability.

Here, we have transformed the negative structure "may not... except" into an affirmative one, and we've further cleaned up the
writing by eliminating an example of passive voice ("carefully vetted
[by dragons] for reliability") and replacing it with active voice.


## Punctuation

... does matter. Really.

People often overlook how important punctuation is to clarity. What
follows is an example of changing the meaning of a sentence drastically,
by inserting commas.

First, we are dealing with a perfectly normal panda:

> The panda eats bamboo shoots and leaves.

With one comma, the panda becomes a picky eater who takes off after
eating the bamboo shoots, rather than also eating the bamboo leaves:

> The panda eats bamboo shoots, and leaves.

And with two commas, we're suddenly dealing with a panda that's a gun
nut with an anger management problem:

> The panda eats bamboo, shoots, and leaves.



### Whitespace

Whitespace normally goes *after* punctuation, not before.

In English (in contrast to some other languages), when whitespace
*precedes* punctuation, it's almost always wrong.  The correct
sequence at the end of a sentence is full-stop (or exclamation mark,
or question mark) *followed* by whitespace. Likewise, it's first comma,
then whitespace. First semicolon, then whitespace.

There are select exceptions to this rule: whitespace does precede the
en dash (–), opening quotation marks, parentheses, brackets, and
braces, and optionally the em dash (—). But whitespace preceding
punctuation *at the end of a sentence* is always an error.[^ellipsis]

[^ellipsis]: [Frederic Hemberger](https://frederic-hemberger.de/) has
  [pointed
  out](https://twitter.com/fhemberger/status/1580079646640525313) that
  there is one exception to the "no whitespace before punctuation at
  the end of a sentence" rule, which is that whitespace does precede a
  trailing ellipsis (…). That is entirely correct, however I'd argue
  that an ellipsis at the end of a sentence is almost always bad form
  in professional communications. When you would use it for an
  open-ended enumeration, it's clearer to instead write "and so on",
  "and others", or "etc."  --- and if you want to illustrate trailing
  off in thought, finish that thought!


### Question marks (?)

Questions should end in a question mark, shouldn't they?

Don't end questions with a full-stop or an exclamation point in
professional writing. That will likely come across as either
passive-aggressive or confrontational. End questions, even rhetorical
ones, with a question mark.


### Exclamation marks (!)

Use no more than one explanation mark per paragraph. Zero is fine, too.

Exclamation marks are something you want to use sparingly. *Never* use
more than one in immediate succession. Limiting yourself to one per
paragraph is a good rule of thumb.


### Semicolons

1. Semicolons are great; splitting the sentence in two is usually better.

2. Semicolons are great. Splitting the sentence in two is usually better.

English mandates that on either side of a semicolon, you have what
constitutes essentially a full sentence with a subject and verb (both
obligatory) and an object (optional). Thus, they give you the option
of just splitting the sentence into two — that is to say, replacing
the semicolon with a full-stop.


### Possessive apostrophe

* Oscars: more than one Oscar 
* Oscar's: of or related to Oscar

A common mistake that native speakers of German or Swedish often make
is the omission of the possessive apostrophe. English doesn't have
much in the way of
[cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case), but does have
something like a [genitive
case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case). If something is of
Oscar, or related to Oscar, it is *Oscar's* — such as Oscar's car,
Oscar's job, Oscar's house. An "Oscars job" is a job for multiple
people named Oscar, or a job at the [Academy
Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscars).


### It's vs. its

Infuriatingly, the possessive apostrophe does not apply when the thing
that something is related to is simply *it*. It would be perfectly
reasonable to assume that when we refer to the car in "the car's roof"
as *it*, it becomes "it's roof", but alas, things don't work that way.

* it's stands for "it is" (or "it has")

* its means "of it"

Yes, this is illogical and immensely confusing. English is weird.


### Parentheses and brackets

*Parentheses* (like these) are always removable, without taking anything
(of significant value) away from the statement.

You can use *square brackets* to shorten quotes.

> To be, or not to be. That is the question. [...] To die, to
> sleep. No more!

*Angle brackets* often serve as placeholders, for when the reader must
replace &lt;important thing&gt; with &lt;other thing&gt;.


### Hyphens and dashes

Often, people think of the three principal forms of dashes as being
interchangeable. They really are not.

* A hyphen, sometimes just called a dash, joins word-pairs together.

* En dashes, that is dashes roughly the width of a lowercase *n*,
  identify things like ranges or dates (March – June, page 47–49).

* Em dashes — like these, which have the width of a lowercase *m* —
  can replace parentheses.


# Avoiding Germglish (and Poglish, and Ukrainglish, etc.)

As with accents, I personally think that we should celebrate the
little language quirks that come from influences of our native
language on English as a second (or third) language. Unfortunately,
not everyone is so tolerant, and sometimes English monolinguals are
*particularly* pesky about these things.

So, what follows are a few little things to think about when it comes
to typical crossovers from our respective native languages, to
English.


## ..., or?

Adding the suffix "..., or?" to a statement that you want to follow up
with a question that asks for confirmation is very common in German
and Swedish. But it is a structure that does not exist in English.

You must instead use an interrogative phrase, such as:

* This is a good idea, *right?*
* That is an excellent proposal, *isn't it?*
* I thought we agree on that, *don't we?*


## "Disturbance"

Swedish and German native speakers often mentally translate the nouns
"störning" or "Störung" into English as "disturbance". This is a
natural error because these derive from the verbs "störa" and
"stören", respectively, for which the English translation is indeed
"disturb".

However, in English "disturbance" is usually read as shorthand for
"civil disturbance", or "disturbance of the peace", which are
euphemisms for a violent riot.

Thus, to an English speaking recipient the statement "we have a
disturbance in our data center" would sound much more dramatic than
the native German sender probably intended it to be.


## Articles

Many Eastern European languages (such as Polish and Ukrainian) don't
use articles, and their native speakers frequently omit them when
speaking English. In standard English however, *the* and *a* are not
optional.

Applicable exceptions are newspaper headlines ("Congress passes law on
guns") and controlled vocabularies (such as troops in combat using
voice procedure, "gunner, sabot, tank, on my command, *fire*").

But in regular spoken and written communications, English speakers use
both definite and indefinite articles.


## Subject

English sentences always mention the subject.

English, unlike Spanish and many Slavic languages, is *not* a null
subject language. With very few exceptions, you can never leave out the
subject in a sentence — even when it would otherwise be clear from
context.

For example, in the English sentence "I am hungry" the "I" is
redundant, because the form "am" uniquely identifies the verb as being
first-person singular. Still, the sentence cannot be shortened to "am
hungry," because that would simply make it incorrect.


## Lowercase "you"

Unlike in German and Polish, English speakers never capitalize *you*
in the middle of a sentence, even when using a polite form of
address. "Thank You for Your help" would look odd and antiquated to
them.

Now, let's move on to clarity of structure.

* * *

# Five paragraphs that matter

Sometimes there are pretty complex things that you want to convey to a
group of people. This is a where lot of people would be inclined to
call a meeting --- but in reality, there's a much better way to do
that, in writing. And doing it in writing will help you do it in a
much clearer, more concise, and more efficient fashion.

Whenever you need to thoroughly **brief a group of people on an
important matter,** in writing, consider using a **5-paragraph
format.**

What follows is a format that is being used by many armed forces; in
NATO parlance it’s called the 5-paragraph field order.


1. Situation
2. Mission
3. Execution
4. Logistics
5. Command and Signal

Now I’m generally not a fan of applying military thinking to civilian
life, but in this case it’s actually something that can very much be
applied to professional communications, with some rather minor
modifications:

1. Situation
2. Objective
3. Plan
4. Logistics
5. Communications


Let’s break these down in a little detail:

1. Situation is about what position we’re in, and **why** we set out
   to do what we want to do. You can break this down into three
   sub-points, like the customer’s situation, the situation of your
   own company, any extra help that is available, and the current
   market.
2. Objective is **what** we want to achieve.
3. Plan is **how** we want to achieve it.
4. Logistics is about what budget and resources are available, and how
   they are used.
5. Communications is about how you’ll be coordinating among yourselves
   and with others in order to achieve your goal.


## What if that's too formal?

Sometimes these headings may look overly formal. People who are not
used to that format might actually find it off-putting. You can
totally use more colloquial headings, to make your communication less
formal. For example:

* Why am I contacting you?

* What do we want to achieve?

* How are we going to do that?

* What will we need?

* How will we communicate?

You'll quickly notice that these map *precisely* to the
concepts of situation, objective, plan, logistics, and
communications. But they sound much more casual and informal and
approachable.


## Updates

Sometimes you need to convey updates to your plan. Then, it's often
not necessary to redo the whole 5 paragraphs. Instead, you just leave
out the bits that are unchanged, compared to your previous plan.

However, it's *always* a good idea to include the following 3 paragraphs:

1. Current Situation
2. Current Objective
3. Updated Plan

And the reason for this is easy to explain. There are really only two
reasons why you would update your plan: either because the situation
is different (the circumstances have changed), or the objective has
been modified. And people should know which of the two it is.


# Meeting notes

It's a very common misconception for people to think that meeting
notes are for the people that were *in* the meeting, so they can
remember what was said.

News flash: if you have people in the meeting that can't remember what
was said, maybe they didn't actually participate and shouldn't have
been there in the first place?

So, who do we write meeting notes for? For the people that **weren't**
in the meeting.

Every meeting needs notes and a summary, and you need to circulate
these notes not only with everyone who attended the meeting, but with
everyone who has a need-to-know.

And the way you write them is so a person wo **wasn't** there, or may
not have known of the meeting, or perhaps even *wasn't part of the
organization* at the time of the meeting, can understand what was
said, what was discussed, and what was decided.

There is one person that I can guarantee is never in a meeting you are
attending today, and that is you, but six months from now. Looking
back at the notes of a meeting *that you participated* in, six months
after the fact, is a terrible experience if the meeting notes are not
good. Writing good meeting notes *today* means making *your* life, six
months from now, easier.


It follows logically, from the requirement that people who were never
in the meeting must be able to read the meeting notes and understand
everything that they need to know about the meeting, that **only the
written word counts.** What's not on the written record in a meeting
**did not happen.**

Who's responsible for meeting notes? The meeting chair (the person
that called the meeting).

Who pulls the meeting notes together? The scribe (the appointed
note-taker).

Who writes the meeting notes? **Everyone.**


## Meeting notes structure

In terms of what you want to include in your meeting notes, here's a
reasonably useful structure.

1. Meeting title
2. Date, time, attendees
3. Summary
4. Discussion points (tabular)
5. Action items

Section 4 would be the longest, and should indeed list everything that
was discussed in the meeting. It is usually practical to organise the
individual points of discussion in a table. If you keep your action
items in issue tracker references, you may also include those in the
table together with the corresponding items you discussed. At that
point, there is no need for a separate section 5.


# And now... the No.1 Awesome Writing Superpower

Here it comes, the No.1 superpower that will improve **all** your
writing, every time. Are you ready?

**Read things out loud.**

For real. I am dead serious about this one. It's pretty safe to say
that **nothing** will improve your writing as much as getting into the
habit of reading things out loud as you edit.

There are a number of reasons for this:

* You can read silently at about 250 words per minute, but you can
  speak at only about 150. Reading things out loud deliberately slows
  down your reading, and gives you a better chance to spot your own
  errors.

* Forcing yourself to recite what you wrote will make it easy to
  detect run-on sentences, confusing phrases, and errors in flow. You
  will naturally want to correct these, and it will make your writing
  better.
  
* Making time to read what you write simply means your mind will stay
  on topic longer than when you just bash something out and
  immediately send or publish it. This additional time gives you the
  opportunity to spot more mistakes, detect errors in your thinking,
  and *have better ideas*.

Do not squander all those opportunities. Read things out loud.

Guess what I did with this article.
